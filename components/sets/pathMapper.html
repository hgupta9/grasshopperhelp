<h3>Perform lexical operations on data trees. Lexical operations are logical mappings between data paths and indices which are defined by textual (lexical) masks and patterns. For example, you could define a lexical rule like "Take the original path but ignore the last index" using the English language. This would be very readable to human beings, but not so for computers. Since we're the intelligent ones, it's only fair that we adapt.</h3>
